Start to learn coding since 2014, been through so many editors, and ended up with neovim.
Basically went from

- `Eclipse`(learning Java)
- `Bracket`(trying web dev)
- `Atom`(back in the days this was recommended)
- `VS Code`(loved by everyone) + `VS Studio`(doing .NET project)
- `JetBrain IDE`(free due to education, tried and love it)
- `Neovim` (I have no choice)

## A little story

There was a class I took called Beginner Web development. I already knew Javascript and was working part-time job on
web development. Aha! I can get high score on this class. Guess what, I dropped the class after the first week.
Our lecturer asked us to use "Adobe Dreamweaver", I was like what the fck is that even? It's some cool fancy stuff that I missed?
I immediately went to google it and found out it's an IDE that deprecated years ago _\*pikachu shock face_\*.
He sent us all a Google Drive link to download the IDE(because it's no longer able to download from official website).
Also, I was using mac (still do now) and tell him I can't run this software on my mac. The response I got was "use
windows laptop instead" ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Good bye, sir.

## How did I start and ended up with vim

Man, I really thought JetBrain is my endgame IDE :( Genuinely happy with JetBrain IDE but one thing: They are very heavy.
I got a new job in 2023 and tasked with building a site with monorepo structure. We have like 5 nestjs,
2 nextjs, 2 vite in the packages folder. My Jetbrain load all day long indexing 9 node modules _RIP_.
